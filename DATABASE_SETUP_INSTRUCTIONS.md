# Database Setup Required

The database tables need to be created. Please follow these steps:

1. Click this link to open your Supabase SQL editor:
   https://app.supabase.com/project/zvtsaikgwozotnjqgntu/sql/new

2. Copy the entire contents of supabase/schema.sql

3. Paste it into the SQL editor and click "Run"

4. Once complete, the authentication will work!

Note: This is a one-time setup step. The automated scripts cannot create tables due to Supabase security restrictions.
